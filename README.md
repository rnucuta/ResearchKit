# ResearchKit
CSE 445 Honors Project.

Research quickly on the go!

ResearchKit is a chrome browser extension that has no interface. The user simply highlights a section of text to research, right clicks it, and selects "ResearchKit." Once they do so, 4 windows will appear on the screen with a Wikipedia search and a Britannica Encyclopedia search along with their respective summaries.

The project uses AWS Lambda and API Gateway to hide OpenAI API password for fulfilling requests!
